# Whale Zone Prediction using Residual Network

> This repository contains the source code for the paper "Leveraging Residual Network to Reduce False Positives in Humpback Whale Occurrences Zone Classification"

We created a new neural network based on residual network (ResNet) to improve the classification performance of whale occurence zones. We addressed several problems in whale occurrence zone classification,

1. Imbalanced dataset with only ~2% positive class
2. Overrepresentation of positive class in the previous study
